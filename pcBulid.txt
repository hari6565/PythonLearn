RAM
2*8GBddr5
2*8GBddr4
if budget and recommented
2*16GBddr5
2*16GBddr4

there is no difference between DDR4 and DDR5 based on performance
but in future game optimazation are more great in DDR5

MOTHERBOARD
must have overclocking support
must have wifi
must have atleast 4 ram slates

PROCESSOR
must have overclocking support
must have integrated graphics atleast 4GB to 8GB
must APU with

MONITOR-
inches 27 to 32

monitor type VA<MiniLED<OLED
these all are best

HDR - High Dynamic Range
impoves the contrast btw the brightest and the darkest spot
resolution
1) 1920x1080-FHD -enougth gaming
2) 2560x1440-GHD- enougth gaming
3) 3840x210-UHD(4K)

AMD FreeSync or NVIDIA G-Sync Compatible

must have VRR property

high pixels have more details
High refresh rate+ Low latency+Fast responce time = best gamin experience
refresh rate
in 120Hz Refresh rate 
time btw frames=8.33ms minimum input lag=4.17ms

in 60Hz Refresh rate 
time btw frames=16.67ms minimum input lag=8.33ms

refresh-rate >=120Hz 
so choose

refresh-rate >=120Hz 
gets
conclusion
24"1080p | 27"1440p
144+Hz Refresh rate
VA | IPS are great,
MiniLED | OLED are better
VRR essential
Response Time < 5ms
(1-2ms ideal)

RAM - 10k
MOTHERBOARD - 6k
PROCESSOR - 12K-15K
MONITOR-10k-15K
SMPS-3K

low
10K+6K+12K+10K+3K = 41k
high
10K+6K+15K+15K+3K = 49k
